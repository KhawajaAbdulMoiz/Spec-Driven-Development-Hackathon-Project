# Chapter 10: Sensor Fusion

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand why robots use multiple sensors
- Learn sensor fusion techniques
- Understand the Kalman filter
- Learn how to combine sensor data

## Introduction

Real robots rarely rely on a single sensor. Combining data from multiple sensors provides more robust and accurate perception.

### Placeholder Content

**Topics to be covered:**
- Multi-sensor systems
- Data fusion algorithms
- Kalman filters
- Uncertainty estimation

## Did You Know?

*Interesting fact about sensor fusion.*
