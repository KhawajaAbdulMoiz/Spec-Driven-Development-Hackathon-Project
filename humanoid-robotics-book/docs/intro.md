# Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This book introduces you to the world of **Physical AI**, **Humanoid Robotics**, sensors, perception, locomotion, actuators, control systems, and modern AI-driven robot architectures.  
It is designed for **beginners** — no robotics background required.

You’ll learn using:
- Simple, human-friendly explanations  
- Real-world examples from Tesla Bot, Boston Dynamics, Agility Robotics, and NVIDIA  
- Diagrams, workflows, and hands-on mini activities  
- AI-generated insights powered by Spec-Kit, Claude, and modern RAG systems
