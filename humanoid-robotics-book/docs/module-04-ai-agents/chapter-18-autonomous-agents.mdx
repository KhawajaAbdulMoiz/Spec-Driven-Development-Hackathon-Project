# Chapter 18: Autonomous Agents

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand autonomous agent architectures
- Learn about behavior trees
- Understand decision-making systems
- Learn about multi-agent systems

## Introduction

Autonomous agents integrate all the concepts learned so far into systems that can make complex decisions independently.

### Placeholder Content
