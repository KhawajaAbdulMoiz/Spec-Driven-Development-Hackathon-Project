# Chapter 4: Robot Brains

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand robot control systems
- Learn about microcontrollers and single-board computers
- Understand real-time operating systems
- Learn how robots make decisions

## Introduction

The robot's "brain" is what controls its behavior. This brain can be simple (a microcontroller) or complex (a full computer with AI software).
