# Chapter 3: Sensors and Actuators

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand what sensors do
- Understand what actuators do
- Identify common sensor types
- Identify common actuator types
- Understand the sensor-brain-actuator loop

## Introduction

Sensors allow robots to perceive their environment, while actuators allow them to act. Together, these form the foundation of robot interaction with the world.

### Placeholder Content

**Topics to be covered:**
- Sensor types (touch, distance, vision, etc.)
- Actuator types (motors, hydraulics, pneumatics)
- The feedback loop
