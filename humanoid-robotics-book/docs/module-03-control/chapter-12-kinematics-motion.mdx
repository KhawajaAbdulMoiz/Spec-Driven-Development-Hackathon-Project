# Chapter 12: Kinematics and Motion

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand forward and inverse kinematics
- Learn about robot motion planning
- Understand joint and task space
- Learn basic dynamics concepts

## Introduction

Kinematics is the mathematics of robot motion. Understanding it allows you to predict and control how robots move.

### Placeholder Content

**Topics to be covered:**
- Forward kinematics
- Inverse kinematics
- Denavit-Hartenberg parameters
